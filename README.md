This is the beginning of my journey into Python and Programming, this is a record of my Programming assignments as part of my APPLIED DATA SCIENCE DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP BSC (HONS). Feel free to take a look and use the files, more than happy to share and help people on their own journey.

### Assignment One ###
Produce design documentation Using the scenario below you are to design a database. This will include the development of conceptual data modelling covering the rules of Normalisation up to 3 rd Normal Form, an entity relationship model with logical relationships (you must list any assumptions), and a data dictionary, which includes the fundamentals.

*Scenario - Dental practice*

The practice surgeries are located in North Wales. The practice wants to have its records computerised and you have been given the job of designing and implementing a database for this purpose. The following scenario gives details of the organisation of the practice and its information requirements that are available to you so far. The dental practice has four branches: Llandudno, Rhos-On-Sea, Conwy and Colwyn Bay. Details of the branch along with full postal addresses and phone numbers are filed by the receptionist of the practice.
A number of staff are employed by the practice; these include surgery manager, Dentists, Hygienists, receptionists and a number of cleaners. Details of the different jobs and job descriptions, salary ranges etc. are filed as well as names, addresses, phone numbers, start dates etc. of all staff. The patients must register themselves, or by a parent/guardian in one of the practice surgeries and they always visit the same surgery. Their names, addresses, phone numbers and medical details are currently kept on record at that surgery.

Prior to the visit, the patient has to book an appointment. The receptionist will check the availability of the Dentist or hygienist prior to completing the booking. Every time a patient visits the surgery, details of the visit are recorded. These include: date and time of appointments, the attending Dentist/hygienist, any diagnoses, advised treatment and any drugs prescribed. Each appointment costs £30; each drug in the prescription costs £6.

*The assignment is weighted at 40% of the complete module. The word count for this assignment is 1600 words.*
